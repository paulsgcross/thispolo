# Is this thing on?

I'm not entirely sure how I got here. In fact, to be honest with you, the last thing I remember was walking down the street -- you know the one -- then suddenly I'm here.

Not much is making sense. Not that it ever made sense to begin with. What was once a cascade of brilliant colour seems to have been replaced with naughts and ones. That beautiful binary only computers speak in.

Well, nice to meet you. Hopefully we will reconvene soon after I adjust to this quaint new home we have found ourselves in.
